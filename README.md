# Sentiment Analysis NLP

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone behind a body of text, which is valuable for understanding opinions, attitudes, and emotions expressed in various forms of communication.

## Project Overview

The repository includes code that applies NLP methods to analyze sentiment in textual data. It contains a Jupyter Notebook titled `Sentiment_analysis_IMDB.ipynb`, which demonstrates sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques to clean and prepare text data for analysis.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of machine learning models suitable for sentiment classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessment of model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary Python libraries:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - tensorflow

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow

```
1. Clone the repository using:
